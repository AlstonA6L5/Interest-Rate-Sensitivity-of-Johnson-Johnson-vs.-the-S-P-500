# Interest-Rate-Sensitivity-of-Johnson-Johnson-vs.-the-S-P-500
When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the stock market often reacts fast and sometimes violently. But does a massive healthcare company like Johnson & Johnson move the same way as the broader S&P 500, or does it behave differently?

  This project explores whether Johnson & Johnson reacts differently to U.S. interest rate changes than the broader stock market. We use historical data on U.S. interest rates along with monthly returns for Johnson & Johnson and the S&P 500 to directly compare how each responds when interest rates rise or fall. This question matters because interest rate increases often create uncertainty for investors, and understanding whether a large healthcare company like Johnson & Johnson is less affected can explain why some stocks are viewed as safer during tightening cycles. We hypothesize that Johnson & Johnson’s stock is less sensitive to U.S. interest rate increases than the S&P 500 because of its stable cash flows and defensive role in the economy.
